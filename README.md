# Welcome to a Pathfinding Visualizer project :compass:

## Pathfinding algorithms visualizer using the most famous algorithms

A-Star, Dijkstraâ€™s, Depth First Search and Breadth First Search are now fully interactive using PyGame

# Steps to run the project
1. Clone the repo
2. Install the dependencies using:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Run the pathfinding_algorithms.py file to start the visualization

# Controls:

- Left-Click to draw start, end node and obstacles
- Right-Click to delete nodes and obstacles

- h = A star algorithm
- j = Dijkstra
- k = BFS
- l = DFS

- v = Clean obstacles
- c = Clean the whole grid
